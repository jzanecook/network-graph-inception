Shared Dependencies:

1. **Python Libraries**: Both "src/reddit_scraper.py" and "src/network_graph.py" will use the Python libraries Scrapy and Pyvis respectively. The "src/main.py" file will also need to import these libraries to run the functions from the other two files.

2. **Scraped Data**: The "src/reddit_scraper.py" will generate the scraped data, which will be stored in "data/scraped_data.json". This JSON file will then be used by "src/network_graph.py" to create the network graph. The "src/main.py" file will also need to access this data to coordinate the scraping and visualization processes.

3. **Functions**: The "src/reddit_scraper.py" file will contain functions for web scraping, such as `scrape_reddit()`. The "src/network_graph.py" file will contain functions for creating the network graph, such as `create_network_graph()`. These functions will be called from the "src/main.py" file.

4. **Utils**: The "src/utils.py" file will contain utility functions that can be used by the other Python files. These might include functions for handling pagination and dynamic content, such as `handle_pagination()` and `handle_dynamic_content()`.

5. **Data Schema**: The data schema for the scraped data will be shared between the "src/reddit_scraper.py" and "src/network_graph.py" files. This schema will define the structure of the data stored in "data/scraped_data.json".

6. **Error Messages**: Error messages, such as `ScrapingError` and `VisualizationError`, might be defined in "src/utils.py" and used across all the other Python files.

7. **Constants**: Constants such as the base URL for Reddit (`REDDIT_URL`) might be defined in "src/utils.py" and used in "src/reddit_scraper.py" for scraping data.
