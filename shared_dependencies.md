1. **Scrapy**: This is a Python library used for web scraping. It is used in "reddit_scraper.py", "items.py", "pipelines.py", "settings.py", "spiders/reddit_spider.py", and "tests/test_reddit_spider.py".

2. **RedditItem**: This is a data schema defined in "items.py" and used in "spiders/reddit_spider.py" and "pipelines.py" to structure the scraped data.

3. **JsonWriterPipeline**: This is a pipeline defined in "pipelines.py" and used in "settings.py" and "spiders/reddit_spider.py" to store scraped data in JSON format.

4. **RedditSpider**: This is a spider defined in "spiders/reddit_spider.py" and used in "reddit_scraper.py" and "tests/test_reddit_spider.py" to extract data from Reddit.

5. **Pyvis**: This is a Python library used for network graph visualization. It is used in "visualization/graph.py" and "visualization/tests/test_graph.py".

6. **NetworkGraph**: This is a class defined in "visualization/graph.py" and used in "reddit_scraper.py" and "visualization/tests/test_graph.py" to visualize structured data in a hierarchical network graph.

7. **TestRedditSpider** and **TestNetworkGraph**: These are test classes defined in "tests/test_reddit_spider.py" and "visualization/tests/test_graph.py" respectively, used to test the functionality of the RedditSpider and NetworkGraph classes.

8. **Scrapy settings**: These are settings used by Scrapy, defined in "settings.py" and used in "reddit_scraper.py" and "spiders/reddit_spider.py".

9. **DOM elements**: The specific DOM elements to be scraped from Reddit would be shared across "spiders/reddit_spider.py" and "tests/test_reddit_spider.py". The exact names would depend on the structure of the Reddit website.

10. **Message names**: Any logging or error messages would be shared across all files where logging or error handling occurs. The exact names would depend on the specific messages used in the code.
