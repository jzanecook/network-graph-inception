1. **Scrapy**: This is a Python library used for web scraping. It is used in "reddit_scraper.py", "items.py", "pipelines.py", "settings.py", "reddit_spider.py", and all the test files.

2. **Pyvis**: This is a Python library for visualizing networks. It is used in "graph_generator.py" and "test_graph_generator.py".

3. **Reddit Data Schema**: This is the structure of the data scraped from Reddit. It is defined in "items.py" and used in "reddit_scraper.py", "pipelines.py", "reddit_spider.py", "test_reddit_spider.py", "test_items.py", and "test_pipelines.py".

4. **JSON**: This is the format in which the scraped data is stored. It is used in "pipelines.py", "reddit_spider.py", and "test_pipelines.py".

5. **Pagination Handling**: This is a feature to handle the dynamic content of Reddit. It is implemented in "reddit_spider.py" and tested in "test_reddit_spider.py".

6. **Network Graph**: This is the visualization of the scraped data. It is created in "graph_generator.py" and tested in "test_graph_generator.py".

7. **Test Cases**: These are used to verify the functionality of the code. They are defined in all the "test_" files.

8. **main.py**: This is the main script that runs the entire program. It uses all the other files.

9. **Exported Variables**: These are the variables that are shared between different files. For example, the scraped data is exported from "reddit_spider.py" to "pipelines.py" and "graph_generator.py".

10. **Function Names**: These are the names of the functions that are used in multiple files. For example, the function to scrape data from Reddit might be used in "reddit_scraper.py", "reddit_spider.py", and "test_reddit_spider.py".
